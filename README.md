# Creator-Trust-Score-System 
This document is a detailed proposal created as part of the Meesho Dice Competition Season 2. 
It outlines a comprehensive “Creator Trust Score System” aimed at strengthening trust within Meesho’s creator-driven marketplace. The proposal addresses critical pain points such as low buyer trust in creator recommendations, high churn among new creators, and the impact of fake reviews or poor-quality content. The solution combines AI-driven moderation, dynamic trust scoring, real-time multilingual feedback, and gamified badge rewards to build credibility and retention among creators, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. The document details the system’s operational flow from content creation to feedback collection, explains the trust score’s influence on creator discovery and sales, and presents a phased go-to-market strategy with a focus on localization and continuous feedback. Drawing on data and real creator testimonials, the proposal demonstrates how enhancing trust can drive higher sales, retention, and engagement, positioning Meesho for scalable, sustainable growth in India’s rapidly evolving creator commerce landscape.
